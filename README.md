# water-measure-server

This project attempts to create a water level real time measurement intended for home cisterns.
The main device measuring the "water level" (technically is just distance) will be an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor paired with a RaspberryPi 3 B+ connected wirelessly to the intenet so the user can access whenever wherever.
